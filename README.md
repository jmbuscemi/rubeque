These are my solutions to the [Rubeque Challenges](http://www.rubeque.com/problems)

I'm using Minitest to run tests for each solution.  Some problems require additional methods/classes to be defined.  I write these methods in the `solutions.rb` file and that is used with the test suite to check my answers.
